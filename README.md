Hey guys, attemped your challenge.
I have never used the camera before so that was tough. Turns out the Camera2 api for android is a monster and very powerful,
and also very complicated.

I spent the first two hours trying to get something going with that before I gave up and went to find a library that might work.
I found this https://github.com/omaflak/Android-Camera2-Library after 2.5 hours in and it didn't reallyget all the way there sadly. And I would have liked more time to fix the errors it was throwing 
and encrypt the stored images.
The images get saved to the app's internal storage but that won't be enough for a prying eye.

This was neat and I learned a lot. Thank you for your consideration.
